require 
=================

Ongoing effort to simplify Oskari programming

Long term goal
- less code and less verbose code

Previously: 
- apply builder pattern to bundles, classes and eventually to any Oskari operations to reduce 
 lines of code required
- add good defaults to any property, constructor, property
- reduce usage of lengthy class identifiers with build pattern

To be implemented
- simplified request handler registrations
