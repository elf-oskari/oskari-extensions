require 
=================

Ongoing effort to simplify Oskari programming

Previously: 
- builder pattern to bundles, classes, flyouts to all Oskari extensions to reduce 
 lines of code required to instantiate a bundle.
- good defaults to any property, constructor, property
- reduce required usage of class identifiers with build pattern

To be implemented
- simplified request handler registrations
